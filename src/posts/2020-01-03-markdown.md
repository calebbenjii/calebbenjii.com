This describes the basics of using Markdown to create articles!

## Paragraphs

For paragraph text, you type a paragraph normally as you would in Microsoft Word or Google Docs. Markdown will automatically create `<p></p>` tags around this.

## Headings

For headings, use `#`. Here are possible styled headings for this blog.

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

## Lists

For list items, you start the line with a number and a decimal (like 1.) Make sure to leave an empty line before starting the `1.`

Here's an example:

1. List item one
2. List item two
3. List item three

For unordered lists, you can use `-` instead of `1.`

- List item one
- List item two
- List item there

## Links

To create a link, use `[Text to show](Actual link)`. [Here's an example that links to Google](https://google.com)

## Bold and italics

- You **bold** words by placing the world between 2 pairs of asterisks.
- You *emphasize with italics* by placing the word between a pair of asterisks

## Images

For images, I prefer to use the `<img>` tag. It's more versatile, and I can use the native lazy loading behavour baked into newer browsers.

ALways add width and height of the image (if possible) because this prevents content from reflowing. (CSS already done for you).

<img loading="lazy" src="/images/2020/example.png" alt="Just a random picture">

### Images with captions

If you want to provide captions, you can use the figure element. Here's the [correct accessible way]() to create a figure with figcaption.

<figure role="figure" aria-label="hello-world">
  <img src="/images/2020/" alt="">
  <figcaption>hello-world</figcaption>
</figure>

## Blockquote

For blockquotes, add `>` before the paragraph of text.

> Zell's probably the most helpful programmer in the world!
>
> <cite>You know who üòù</cite>

## Code

For inline code blocks, enclose the code with backticks. Here's an `example`.

For code blocks, use triple backticks. You can add the code language right after the opening triple backticks. Supported languages are:

1. HTML: `html`
2. CSS: `css`
3. JavaScript: `js`

If you need more languages, select what you need from [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/), download the JavaScript file, and overwrite `src/js/lib/prism.js`.

```js
const firstName = 'Zell'
const lastName = 'Liew'
console.log('Buffalo is pretty cool!')
```
